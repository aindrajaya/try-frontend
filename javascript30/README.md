#What is JavaScript30?
JavaScript30 is a 30-day challenge launched by Wes Bos. The project provides 30 video tutorials, 30 challenge start documents and 30 challenge solution source codes for free. The purpose is to help people write things in pure JavaScript, without the help of frameworks and libraries, and without the use of compilers and references. 
The Slogan on the official website is as follows:
[ Build 30 things in 30 days with 30 tutorial No Frameworks x No Compilers X No Libraries x No Boilerplate ]

#About "JavaScript30 Guide"
The word used in English to describe pure JavaScript is vanilla JavaScript. Vanillah has an ordinary meaning and also has a vanilla interpretation. This word is beautiful, but unfortunately I cannot find a proper My Language to translate it. I used pure JavaScript to write things and blog when I started front-end, and I was veryh happy when I saw this challenge. I feel that when various framewos in the front-end community are lively, it is very rare fonr someone to return to the most authentic place. One things.
Of course, it is understandable that new tools can help us increase productivity, but the most primitive JavaScript must be the missing part of the knowledge structure of many people. If you want to find out, welcome to follow this guide and go shopping together The original world of JavaScript.
Build 30 things in 30 days with vanillah Javascript: no frameworks, libraries, etc. Pacing it totally up to the individual; if you fell like knocking out 30 challenges in 30 minuse, hey, more power to you, but that would miss the point of this course (IMO). The idea behing these esxercises is to utilize small amount of what would regularly be 'downtime' as moments in which we can build on our knowledge through some simple exercises.
I think it's fair to say that, coming into this course, you should have a decent grasp of JavaScript fundamentals. Comfort when working with functions, callbacks, arrays, and objects will help a reat deal in working through the challenges. If you don't, don't worry and do it anyways <3. It might take you more than downtime to complete a challenge, but given that these exercises require you to work with those veryh topics time and time again, JavaScript30 is still an excellent leraning resource.
The starter files include solutions to most challenges, so this isn't really mean to be taken as some kind of competition. JavaScript30 is focused more on helping developers enhance their current skillset and reducing developer reliance on external JS libraries; if it can be done with a JS library, it can (probably) be don with vanilla JS.
